# Quiche Quest

## Barbara Fontaine
**10th May 2015**

The quest gets under way with "Barbara Fontaine" a take on the class Lorraine.

Overall the quiche tasted delicious and was quickly gobbled. The first time errors were a lack of marbles and a quick thinking quiche hunter put together a foil and pennies equivalent.

**The Good:** light and fluffy, thyme, bacon, quiche.

**The Bad:** lack of marbles, too small a baking tray
