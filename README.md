# Quiche Quest

## Jose's Sausage
**18th May 2015**

The quest took a small step for mankind, but a giant quiche-shaped leap for tasty treats in it's second stab at whipping up a masterpiece.

For a second week, the quiche was nommed down pretty sharpish with no complaints about the under-cooked pastry... because this week, THERE WAS NONE! Blind-baking beads were purchased and actually used in almost the right way. (I'll pretend I missed Ian knocking a wedge of pastry off the edge trying to scoop up hot stones)

**The Good** light and fluffy again, tasty meaty sausage

**The Bad** took a bit long... bedtime sausage's quichy companion

## Barbara Fontaine
**10th May 2015**

The quest gets under way with "Barbara Fontaine" a take on the classic Lorraine.

Overall the quiche tasted delicious and was quickly gobbled. The first time errors were a lack of marbles and a quick thinking quiche hunter put together a foil and pennies equivalent.

**The Good:** light and fluffy, thyme, bacon, quiche.

**The Bad:** lack of marbles, too small a baking tray
