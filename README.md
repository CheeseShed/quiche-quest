# Quiche Quest

## Welsh Popeye
**12th July 2015**

After quiching ourselves out in May we return to the land of egg and cheese. This time we decided to take on a new challenge; make the pastry ourselves and for added difficulty we're using gluten free flour.

As this was the first time we had made pastry we ran into some difficulty with the recipe. After leaving the dough in the fridge we discovered it to be sticky and awkward to roll out. However, after some gentle manipulation we forced the dough into the baking tin.

For the filling we used spinach, leeks and a little bacon and garlic. The result was delicious apart from the troubles with making the pastry. Gluten free quiche is a success.

**The Good** spinach and leek quiche is delicious

**The Bad** more practice is needed when it comes to making dough from scratch especially when it is gluten free

## Jose's Sausage
**18th May 2015**

The quest took a small step for mankind, but a giant quiche-shaped leap for tasty treats in it's second stab at whipping up a masterpiece.

For a second week, the quiche was nommed down pretty sharpish with no complaints about the under-cooked pastry... because this week, THERE WAS NONE! Blind-baking beads were purchased and actually used in almost the right way. (I'll pretend I missed Ian knocking a wedge of pastry off the edge trying to scoop up hot stones)

**The Good** light and fluffy again, tasty meaty sausage

**The Bad** took a bit long... bedtime sausage's quichy companion

## Barbara Fontaine
**10th May 2015**

The quest gets under way with "Barbara Fontaine" a take on the classic Lorraine.

Overall the quiche tasted delicious and was quickly gobbled. The first time errors were a lack of marbles and a quick thinking quiche hunter put together a foil and pennies equivalent.

**The Good:** light and fluffy, thyme, bacon, quiche.

**The Bad:** lack of marbles, too small a baking tray
